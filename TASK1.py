3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen."""

Number_1 = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
Number_2 = int(input("Enter the second number : "))

Addition = (Number_1) + (Number_2)
print("Addition : ", Addition)

Subtraction = (Number_1)-(Number_2)
print("Subtraction : ", Subtraction)

Multiplication = (Number_1) * (Number_2)
print("Multiplication :", Multiplication)

Division = Number_1/Number_2
